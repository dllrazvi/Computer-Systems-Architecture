                                                   Computer Systems Architecture – My Assembly Journey
 This repo gathers all my assembly projects—labs, practice tasks, and exam solutions—for the Computer Systems Architecture course. I went well beyond requirements, tackling extra challenges to deepen my understanding.

# What I did:
- Wrote numerous x86‑16 and x86‑64 assembly programs (beyond the assigned tasks)
- Handled each phase: data definitions, register operations, control flow, and syscalls
- Built and debugged real programs on emulators and Linux using NASM and GDB
- Solved extra problems involving arithmetic logic, loops, conditionals, and function calls

# What I learned:
- How assembly maps to CPU execution—moves, jumps, flags, stack—building intuition about low-level computation 
- The inner workings of memory layout, including data segments and endianness 
- Techniques for debugging & stepping through registers in GDB, improving fault-finding skills
- The importance of precision and attention to detail when managing bytes, words, and register state
- Fundamentals of system-level programming, like invoking syscalls and organizing code across multiple files
